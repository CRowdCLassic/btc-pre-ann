Pre Annoucement! â–ºâ–º CRowdCLassic (CRCL) - Brings value to the technology

What is CRowdCLassic project?

Long story short: It is a successor of the Crowdcoin project network. They made a swap and moved from Neoscrypt to another algorhytm so the old network was abandoned. A decission was made to continiue the support of it because the network prove herself to be relaible and trustworthy one. 
But the main reason was to stand behind the original idea: to create a place were people interested in crypto meet people who want to share and develop this knowledge - to put it in layman`s terms- an academy and an ico platform. And even to broaden it - to create a social network for the crypto realm. 
And at last but not at least: to put the technology where it belongs - before the value. Because it`s a way better to have sustainable demand created by the features a given technology has not by speculating with eventual future value. 
The project will be community driven for real and supported by donations at first then with small dev fee in every block generated. You can send coin to CLaUTqyiDcs1Hens3Qxpb7JSx6sKKTSjNn to donate directly or by pointing a miner to our official pool: http://pool.crcl.dns-cloud.net - it has 100% fee (all generated coins) so use it for failsafe pool or if you want to support the network.
It will be an anonymous effort until the support for this project get stronger. 

So after a week of extencive research and serious decision making, this is the next generation of this project`s coin: CRowdCLassic.

COIN SPECIFICATION:
Name: CRowdCLassic
Ticker: CRCL
Address Letter: C
Algorithm: Neoscrypt
ICO: None
Current Supply: ~5100000
Max. Supply: 10,900,000
Block Time: 120 seconds
Spend: 10 confirmations
Block: 100 confirmations
Block Reward: 20 CRCL, halving every year - next is coming around 22.12.18 (Don`t miss this opportunity, right ;)
Reward distribution: 50% POW, 50% Masternode
Masternode Collateral: 1000 CRCL
Premine: There were 200 000 coins left in an address from before the swap. There is unknown amount of coins collected from the swap also - this matter will be investigated further and the decisions will be made according to the result of it.
As this may look scary now from the market PoV, it can be considered a low risk on the long run. (This will be explained in detail later.)

How to get CRCL coins?

1. You can mine them at POOLS supporting CRCL through well-known miner software:

[code]  -a scrypt -o stratum+tcp://1pool.pw:4233 -u WALLET-p c=CRCL    [/code]

STATS: http://1pool.pw/?address=<WALLET_ADDRESS>  

2. Converting them from CRC: the new wallet has backward compatibility - just COPY your old CRC wallet.dat to the CRowdCLassicCore folder, restart, and you`ll have the same amount of CRCL. Jusl like that :)
But don`t forget: this is NOT a fork so when you move your CRCL coins elsewhere, they will disapear from your CRC wallet too.

EXCHANGES: 
None for now but there`s no hurry. As it`s been said - put the technology first :)

QUICK ROADMAP:
1. Manifesto is in the making.
2. Support the network: 
 - a new wallets has to be compiled with a few things replaced. Done
 - putting some pool and  nodes online to support the blockchain. Done
 - a manual with explanation how to create a masternode. Done.
 - (eventually) a manual with explanation how to mine to a wallet - local or remote.
3. An explorer has to be started using some scripts available. In the making.
4. A website to present the project. In the making.
5. Whitepaper to explain the project deeper. And Yellowpaper after that, filled with technical stuff to explain it further. 
6. Complete the assessment of the project. 
7. Moving to POW/POS/MN code.
8. MVP: A portal for learning and crowdfunding (the original project idea), created using some particular social software available right now. Implementing gamification instead of airdrops and using CRCL as an utility coin only.
- There will be no real coins kept on the site, an quantities only. They will be stored in account(s) on an exchange.
- KYC through third-party company.
- Mobile apps.  
9. Complete code audit by a third-party company.
10. Hail everybody from the Moon. 

IMPORTANT LINKS:
There were enourmous amount of research and sleepless nights so all the pressing issues were resolved (see the commits in the repo for more info). But again: keep in mind that this is experimental software at this stage. Use on your own rirk. Think twice and always backup..

Old wallets for you to test and play with: https://github.com/CRowdCLassic/crowdclassic-core/releases/tag/1.1.1b
Explorer: http://pool.crcl.dns-cloud.net/explorer/CRCL - it is basic but enough for now. The incoming one will be based on more soffisticated script like ciquidus or else. 
Masternode Setup/Guide: https://github.com/CRowdCLassic/masternode-install 
Website: https://crcl.dns-cloud.net/ - Temporary to show commitment, a new domain name will be bought.

P.S. So the thing are a little off right now but everything will fall into place the next few days. It was a crazy ride..
P.P.S. This topic is self-modarated.
P.P.P.S. This project has no connection with the previous owner whatsoever. Maybe it`s hard to believe now but the time will show.
