You have probably heard of Kickstarter© or watched Shark Tank©.  How would you like to be a Kickstarter© or a Shark?  We have developed a platform to bring these two avenues of investing in new companies to the world of cryptocurrency.  CFUND will accept applications from startup companies looking for investments to get their product launched.  These applications will be listed on our platform and you will be able to purchase their product exclusively with CFUND currency at below retail price prior to production.  The blockchain will be used to create smart contracts ensuring that your CFUNDs are secure until product delivery.  Some of the applicants looking for investments from CFUND will have the option to trade a percentage of their company for CFUND coins that they can sell on the exchange for FIAT to cover startup costs.  This is where Masternode holders come in, and they get to be the sharks.  We will use the blockchain to allow all of the masternode holders to vote on which companies get direct support from CFUND.  Masternode holders will also get dividends from the companies when they become profitable.  The amount of support will be dependent on the market capitalization of CFUND and the number of businesses selected to support per year.

About CRCL
This is the era of blockchain and crowdfunding. This is the era of disruption. The emerging crypto market is comprised of a new and distinct set of investors and entrepreneurs. A new economic ecosystem has surfaced, causing substantial disruptions to the traditional payment services and banking industry. Revolutionary digital assets like BTC, ETH, XRP (and many others) are generating new archetypes for financial transactions and creating alternate channels of wealth. In late February 2018, in the firm’s 10-K filed with the SEC, Bank of America admitted that cryptocurrencies were “a threat to its business model.” This was not untrue. Intermediaries, banks, and payment service providers are scrambling to keep pace.


How do I get it?

You will be able to get your hands on some CrowdFund Coin initially during our presale, followed by watching for our symbol CFUND on the exchanges.  Since the Crowd in CrownFund is you guys, we will need your help to bring CFUND to its fullest potential. To do that, there will be bounties that can be completed for CFUND rewards.



 You can use the old ones and ready just wallet.dat into the new one and voila
